Mimosa, the mixed models special agent is a shiny app for 2-level mixed
models.

# Installation

No need to install the app, just go to www.mimosa.icu and use it there.
An example data file is loaded when you go to www.mimosa.icu/example.

If you really want to use it locally, pull the development version from
github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("johannes-titz/mimosa")
```

And now run the app:

``` r
shiny::run_app()
```

Yes, it is that easyâ€“at least under GNU/Linux\!

If you have any problems installing mimosa, check that your R version is
up to date (currently 3.6.1). If you are using Windows, enable TLS 1.2
in the Internet Options Advanced tab (see
<https://github.com/r-lib/remotes/issues/130#issuecomment-423830669>).

If it still does not work drop me an e-mail at johannes at titz.science
or at johannes.titz at gmail.com.
