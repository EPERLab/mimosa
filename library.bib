		  pointing to the need to study effectiveness for sub-groups
		  within each school as well as overall. The results of a
		  multilevel analysis of a large dataset covering the years
		  1985, 1986 and 1987 and using examination performance as
		  the outcome measure are presented, revealing substantial
		  differences between ethnic groups. The findings also show
		  that the effectiveness of a school varies along several
		  dimensions, and that there is also variation over time. The
		  implications of these findings are discussed.},

@Article{	  west2012,
  abstract	= {At present, there are many software procedures available
		  enabling statisticians to fit linear mixed models (LMMs) to
		  continuous dependent variables in clustered or longitudinal
		  data sets. LMMs are flexible tools for analyzing
		  relationships among variables in these types of data sets,
		  in that a variety of covariance structures can be used
		  depending on the subject matter under study. The explicit
		  random effects in LMMs allow analysts to make inferences
		  about the variability between clusters or subjects in
		  larger hypothetical populations, and examine cluster- or
		  subject-level variables that explain portions of this
		  variability. These models can also be used to analyze
		  longitudinal or clustered data sets with data that are
		  missing at random (MAR), and can accommodate time-varying
		  covariates in longitudinal data sets. While the software
		  procedures currently available have many features in
		  common, more specific analytic aspects of fitting LMMs
		  (e.g., crossed random effects, appropriate hypothesis
		  testing for variance components, diagnostics, incorporating
		  sampling weights) may only be available in selected
		  software procedures. With this article, we aim to perform a
		  comprehensive and up-to-date comparison of the current
		  capabilities of software procedures for fitting LMMs, and
		  provide statisticians with a guide for selecting a software
		  procedure appropriate for their analytic goals.},
